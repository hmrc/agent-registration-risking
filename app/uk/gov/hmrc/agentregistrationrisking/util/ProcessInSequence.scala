   * Unlike `processInSequence`, this method does not stop processing when an item fails. Instead, it continues processing all items in the sequence. When
   * an item's processing fails, the `onFailure` hook is called with the exception and the failed item, allowing for custom error handling (e.g., logging).
   *
   * This is particularly useful when you need to process a batch of items and want to ensure all items are attempted, even if some fail, while still being
   * notified of failures.
   *
   * @param items
   * The sequence of items to process.
   * @param f
   * The asynchronous function to apply to each item. Failures are caught and handled via the onFailure hook.
   * @param onFailure
   * A callback function invoked when processing of an item fails. It receives the exception and the item that failed.
   * @return
   * A Future containing the count of successfully processed items.
